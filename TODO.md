## Keyboard Tracking

Basically I want to track the keyboard on the keyboard UI
Example: when you press "A" it will act like you pressed "A" on the Virtual keyboard
I don't know if this will work but just an idea I might add

## Better Highlighting

Sometimes when you click the button for a key it will stay highlighted
The key won't work until you press the key again (pressed is staying true maybe?)

## Better keyboard position

I want the keyboard to be positioned via the position of the textbox (if possible)
Otherwise it will use the default will be how it is currently

## Other

There will probably be more as I find out more/do more
